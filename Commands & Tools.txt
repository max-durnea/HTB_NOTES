#Socat - a tool like netcat with more functionality like port forwarding and connecting to
		 serial devices

#Common ports - https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf

#Tmux Cheatsheet - https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/

#Vim - hit "i" for "insert mode"
	   hit "esc" for "leave insert mode"
	   "x" : "cut character"
	   "dw" : "cut word"
	   "dd" : "cut full line"
	   "yw" : "copy word"
	   "yy" : "copy full line"
	   "p" : "paste"
	tip: we can multiply any command:
		 for example: 4yw would copy 4 words instead of one
		":" : "command mode"
	After entering command mode:
		":1" : "go to line 1"
		":w" : "write the file, save"
		":q" : "quit"
		":q!" : "quit without saving"
		":wq" : "write an quit"
		
#nmap - PORT    STATE   SERVICE
		21/tcp  open  	ftp
		
		"If no options then scans the 1000 most common ports"
		"By default it performs a TCP scan where it does a TCP handshake"
		
		"filtered STATE means the port has a firewall"
		"SERVICE tells the name of the service typically mapped to that port"
		"The default scand doesn't tell the process listening on that port
		 by default. We need to instruct it"
		
		PARAMETERS:
			"-sC" : "use scripts to obtain more detailed information"
			"-sV" : "service scan to display the detailed info about the service
					 running on that port"
			"-p-" : "scan all ports"
		"nmap -sV --script=banner <target>" : Banner Grabbing

#smbclient - "allows communication and enumeration with SMB shares"
			 "smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253":
				"-L" : "retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host"
				"-N" : "supress the password prompt"

##WEB ENUMERATION

#gobuster - "Used for directory/file enumeration"
			"Example" : "gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt"
			
			"Responses" :
				200 - successful
				403 - forbidden
				301 - redirection
			
			"gobuster can be used for DNS subdomain enumeration"
			"For this you'll have to:
				Clone and install -seclists- that contains many useful
				lists for fuzzing and exploitation.
				
				Have a DNS server like 1.1.1.1 in /etc/resolv.conf
				
				use the "dns" option in gobuster
				
				"Example" : "gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt"
				
				This will show ass all the subdomains found using that wordlist

#curl - "Used for retrieving web pages"
		"Can be used for banner grabbing"
		
		"Example" : "curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com"
		"This will show us what's hosted on the web server"
		
#whatweb - "Similar to curl but with more functionalities for web enumeration"

"Certificates" - Certificates like SSL/TLS are a valuable source of information if the server uses HTTPS
The info gained can be used for phishing attacks

"robots.txt" - A common thing is for websites to contain a robots.txt file that is used to instruct
web crawlers about the resources that can and cannot be accessed for indexing

"Source code" - it's worth checking the source code that can reveal forgotten comments used 
				during testing and vulnerable scripts and addresses left on the front-end side
				

##Public Exploits

#searchsploit - "used for finding public exploits of an application"
				"sudo apt install exploitdb -y"
				
				"Example" : "searchsploit openssh 7.2"
				
#msfconsole - "Metasploit has many built-in exploits for an easy way to exploit vulnerable targets"
			to search for an exploit use "search exploit"
			then "use <name>"
			> Also you might have to configure options using "show options" and
			changing the Required set to YES fields to the corresponding values using "set <var> <value>"
			> Then use "check" and then "run" or "exploit" to run the exploit 
			

##Connections

#Netcat - "Use it for Opening ports or Connecting to ports and talking"
		  "Can and is used to establish a REVERSE/BIND SHELL connections"
		  
		  "Example" : "nc -lvnp 1234"
					"PARAMETERS" :
						-l : Listen Mode
						-v : Verbose Mode
						-n : Disable DNS resolution to speed up connection
						-p 1234 : port number to listen on

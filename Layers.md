# Layers

## Layer No.1: Internet Presence
 At this Layer we focus on finding the targets we can investigate. We use different techniques to find **Domains, subdomains, netblocks etc.**

## Layer No.2: Gateway
 Here we try to understand the interface of the reachable target, how it's **protected** and where it is located in the **network**.

## Layer No.3: Accessible Services
 Here we examine the services each destination offers. We need to **know how they work**. Otherwise we need to **learn to understand them**

## Layer No.4: Processes
 Every time a command or function is executed, data is processed, whether entered by the user or generated by the system. This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks, and such tasks have at least one source and one target.

## Layer No.5: Privileges
 Each service runs through a specific **user** in a particular **group** with **permissions** and **privileges**. These privileges can provide us with useful functions

## Layer No.6: OS Setup
 Here we collect information about the actual **operating system** and its setup using internal access. The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.

# 🧪 Scanning and Enumeration

## Nmap

```text
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
21/tcp  open     ftp

# Notes:
- Scans the 1000 most common ports by default.
- Default scan performs a TCP handshake.
- "filtered" state means a firewall is blocking the port.
- "SERVICE" shows the typical service name.
- To see the actual process, specify additional flags.

# Parameters:
-sC     → default scripts for detailed info  
-sV     → service/version detection  
-p-     → scan all ports

# Banner Grabbing:
nmap -sV --script=banner <target>
```

## smbclient

```bash
# Enumerate SMB shares:
smbclient -N -L \\10.129.42.253

# Flags:
-L     → list available shares  
-N     → suppress password prompt
```

# 🌐 Web Enumeration

## Gobuster

```bash
# Directory enumeration:
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

# Response codes:
200 → successful  
403 → forbidden  
301 → redirection

# DNS subdomain enumeration:
gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt

# Prerequisites:
- Install SecLists  
- Set a DNS server like 1.1.1.1 in /etc/resolv.conf
```

## curl

```bash
# Banner grabbing:
curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com
```

## whatweb

Like curl but more powerful for web enumeration.

## Certificates

SSL/TLS certificates may leak useful metadata for phishing or enumeration.

## robots.txt

This file tells crawlers what to ignore. It can expose sensitive or hidden directories.

## Source Code

Always check the source code of web pages. Developers sometimes leave sensitive info in comments or JavaScript.

# Using wget:
wget http://<your_ip>:8000/<file>

# Or using curl:
curl -O http://<your_ip>:8000/<file>
